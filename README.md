# Support-Vector-Machine-Classifier-with-Gaussian-Kernel
## Objective
Train the SVM classifier for a non-separable case with Gaussian Kernel.

## Method
- The same insurance data set. Take 60% of the obervations for training, and the rest to test the classifier. Stratified sampling is used. 
- Use priciple component analysis to reduce the dimension of the predictors.
- Use quadratic programming for the dual formulation of the optimization problem.
